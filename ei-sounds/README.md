# Edge Impulse Example: Gestures
This runs a trained model of the sounds project with live classification.

## The story
I want to get my hands on machine learning at the edge.
This is the second example of edge impulse to get in touch with with sound handling.

The goal was to detect clapping my hands, snapping with the fingers and clcking the tongue.

* I recorded sound features with the Arduino Nano BLE sense.
* Finding the values for the Audio MFCC is really hard.
* The frequency of the sound pattern is very low and hard to seperate.
* As a conclusion, the accuracy of model is low.

## features
### snap (with the fingers)
### click (with the tongue)
### oneclap (with the hands)
### twoclaps (with the hands)

## Platform
Developed in Ardunio IDE for the Nano BLE 33 Sense board.
